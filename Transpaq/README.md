The core application which "implants" itself into the system, and then runs as a thread for the server portion
which simply waits for commands to save or update new programs sent to it. All dlls are stored in the registery (so not on disk)
and executed in memory.

**For educational purposes only**

The copying of the exe is hardcoded (the name) so implant helper is not fully working and it doesnt start up during windows booting up... These were minor things that I intended to complete when other stuff was working but never got there lol.
