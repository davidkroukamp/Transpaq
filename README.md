# Transpaq
The application "implants" itself into the system when run, and then runs as a thread which creates a server on the 
host machine, which simply waits for commands to save or update new programs sent to it.
All dlls are stored in the registery (so not on "disk") and executed in memory.

**For educational purposes only**

TODO The copying of the exe via implant helper is not fully working as it doesnt start up during windows booting up...
